== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will there ever be more options added? =

Yes, I do have plans on adding more options for this plugin. For instance, I plan on adding a page in the WordPress admin panel for you to be able to edit the CSS so the author box can be styled to fit with your theme design.

= What are the default CSS codes? =

As of version 1.3, the css is contained in it's own style.css file within the plugin folder instead of directly added to the html of your web page.

You can copy/paste the below css codes into your themes CSS file and adjust them accordingly in order to override the css that's been added with the plugin.
