<span style="color: #333333;">Re-structuring always comes hand-in-hand with changes in personnel deployment, which is one of the most challenging areas in business management.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In the past, companies have often chosen to make the affected personnel redundant during restructuring phases, but this is the most disruptive option for all sides involved, as it leads to the loss of what could be highly trained and loyal workers. It is also one of the most expensive options, due to redundancy payments.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Because of this, many businesses are now choosing to re-deploy their personnel from redundant roles to other areas of their company, rather than making them redundant.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">While it makes sense for organizations to choose redeployment as a better option, the actual planning and execution of it </span>is<span style="color: #333333;"> often more difficult than anticipated, which may cause major problems.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In order to help you get it right, weâ€™ve compiled our top tips on how to manage employee redeployment successfully:</span>
<ol>
 	<li>
<h2 style="font-size: xx-large;"><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: #333333;"><strong> Perform detailed structural mapping and analysis of your company</strong></span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">Before starting any redeployment efforts, first, you need an in-depth understanding of the roles that are no longer useful, as well as the areas where there is a potential for growth in your company. Departments that are ready to grow obviously offer job opportunities that might be successfully filled with existing staff.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Part of this analysis includes an assessment of the feasibility of retraining specific staff roles for other jobs. For example, a sales executive is very unlikely to become a good software engineer in a short time but could do very well in the marketing department, given some good training.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">At this stage you should also start to coordinate with managers in key positions and get their input on the skills that are already present and well developed in your existing talent pool, as this will inform the decision of how to redeploy them</span></li>
 	<li>
<h2 style="font-size: xx-large;"><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: #333333;"><strong>Carefully plan the redeployment process</strong></span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">In order for redeployment to work smoothly (especially at a large scale), it needs to be planned in advance as precisely as possible.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">First of all, youâ€™ll want to put a date on when the redundant department will be terminated. Secondly, you need to assess when new job openings will be available in other departments. Obviously, these dates need to line up with each other. Once you have a good match, you can then set up a schedule for redeployment.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Itâ€™s often beneficial to perform redeployment in several phases. In other words, youâ€™ll start by redeploying parts of the department you want to shut down, before proceeding with the rest. Start with those parts that are more peripheral, and therefore less essential, and redeploy the critical parts last.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Once you have set up a schedule for redeployment, you can then start organizing the training that will be necessary for the transition.</span></li>
 	<li>
<h2 style="font-size: xx-large;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 24pt;"><strong> Communicate with your candidates for redeployment</strong></span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">In order for redeployment to succeed, youâ€™ll need the full support of the staff you want to redeploy. Itâ€™s likely that not everyone will be on board with your plan, and at this stage, you need to determine the willingness and flexibility within your talent pool.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">If staff members are highly resistant to changing their roles, itâ€™s better not to force them, and to offer them redundancy instead. Focus your efforts on those who want to stay in your company, and prioritize those who are most willing to redeploy.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">At this point, youâ€™ll also want to map the skillset, experience, and qualifications present in your talent pool at the level of each individual. Everyone has a different background and personality, and these details can affect the redeployment process.</span></li>
 	<li>
<h2 style="font-size: xx-large;"><span style="color: #333333; font-size: 24pt;"><strong>Promote the redeployment opportunity to your employees</strong></span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">If some of your staff members are unsure about redeployment, a great way to motivate them is with the opportunity of learning new skills that will be part of their new roles. The incentive of learning valuable skills is a great motivator for many people.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In addition, let your employees know how much you value their loyalty, and that you count on their help in new roles. Recognition by the leadership is another powerful incentive that motivates people to make the effort of transitioning into a new role.</span></li>
 	<li>
<h2 style="font-size: xx-large;"><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: #333333;"><strong> Organize and run the training</strong></span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">Good training is essential for successful redeployment.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In-house trainers are often the best choice, and in the case of redeployment, it can be a great idea to have your redeployment candidates be trained by their new team members.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">However, if the new department canâ€™t spare anyone for training purposes, youâ€™ll have to bring in trainers from the outside. Make sure there is sufficient time for the training, and those good trainers are available and ready in time.</span></li>
 	<li>
<h2 style="font-size: xx-large;"><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: #333333;"><strong>Set a trial period for the redeployed staff</strong></span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">Once you have successfully trained and transitioned your staff into new roles, you still need to make sure that they are actually a good fit for their new roles. To do this, give them a trial period of six months to prove their quality in the new position.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Be prepared to let go of some people even at this stage, since itâ€™s more important to fill your positions with the best individuals, rather than holding on to every employee.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2 style="font-size: xx-large;"><span style="font-size: 24pt; color: #333333;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">A strategic redeployment is a powerful tool that can be used to benefit from a highly trained, loyal, and motivated workforce in different roles. Properly executed, it can give any company a competitive edge in a highly dynamic and changing economic environment, which necessitates regular re-structuring.</span>";s:10:"post_title";s:58:"6 Tips On How To Manage Employee Redeployment Successfully";s:12:"post_excerpt";s:0:"";s:11:"post_status";s:7:"publish";s:14:"comment_status";s:4:"open";s:11:"ping_status";s:4:"open";s:13:"post_password";s:0:"";s:9:"post_name";s:48:"6-tips-manage-employee-redeployment-successfully";s:7:"to_ping";s:0:"";s:6:"pinged";s:0:"";s:13:"post_modified";s:19:"2017-08-31 08:03:24";s:17:"post_modified_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-31 08:03:24";s:21:"post_content_filtered";s:0:"";s:11:"post_parent";s:1:"0";s:4:"guid";s:36:"https://leadingchange.com.au/?p=2554";s:10:"menu_order";s:1:"0";s:9:"post_type";s:4:"post";s:14:"post_mime_type";s:0:"";s:13:"comment_count";s:1:"0";}i:1;O:8:"stdClass":23:{s:2:"ID";s:4:"2590";s:11:"post_author";s:1:"3";s:9:"post_date";s:19:"2017-08-31 08:52:48";s:13:"post_date_gmt";s:19:"2017-08-31 08:52:48";s:12:"post_content";s:6760:"<span style="color: #333333;">While itâ€™s great to be very confident about the success of your project, itâ€™s also essential to have a plan in case things go wrong. Even the most promising projects can run into serious obstacles, so a good executive must be prepared to deal with all eventualities.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">A risk is defined as a potential situation that, if it arises, could have a negative effect on the success of your project.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">There are four fundamental ways to manage risk, which we describe below, plus our tips on how to implement each of them successfully.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Risk assessment and planning</strong></span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">When launching a new project, itâ€™s important to define the project risks as precisely as possible. That way, if things do go wrong, youâ€™ll be ready to handle them well.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Ideally, you should start a new project with a list of potential risks, plus a precise plan for how to deal with each risk, should it become a reality.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">When you assess the risks, each risk should be given a value of the <strong>probability</strong> of it occurring, plus the <strong>impact</strong> it would have on the successful outcome of the project. Probability and impact are scored on a scale from 1 to 10.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Based on the risk assessment values, youâ€™ll be able to prioritize the risks with the highest probability and impact for your risk management strategy.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In addition, you need to revise the list of risks as the project unfolds, because new developments can add new risks that you should be aware of.</span>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Four main approaches to manage risk</strong></span></h2>
<ol>
 	<li>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Risk avoidance
</strong></span></h3>
<span style="color: #333333;">Especially in the case of risks that have <strong>high</strong> <strong>probability</strong> and <strong>impact</strong> values, it may be best to modify your project strategy to avoid them altogether.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">An example of this could be that specific expertise and/or technology may become critical for the success of the project, but these resources are presently not available, or fully developed in your company.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In that </span>case<span style="color: #333333;"> hire the appropriate experts, or purchase the appropriate technology in order to avoid the risk.</span></li>
 	<li>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Â Risk transference</strong></span></h3>
<span style="color: #333333;">If your project involves several partners, itâ€™s possible to transfer some of the risks to the other parties.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">A common example of this would be when a business hires or partners with an outside company to deal with a specific technology. In that case, all risks associated with that technology could be transferred to the outside company.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">If you choose this option, make sure that the risk transfer is properly documented in the contract you sign with an outside partner.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Another example of risk transfer is insurance. You can hire an insurance company to deal with specific risks so that you donâ€™t have to worry about managing them. Again, this should be contractually documented in great detail.</span></li>
 	<li>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Risk mitigation
</strong></span></h3>
<span style="color: #333333;">Mitigation of a risk essentially means that you have a plan in place to reduce the effect of a specific risk if it should occur. In other words, the problem caused by the risk will be smaller due to your risk mitigation.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">A good example of risk mitigation is planning for the eventuality that you wonâ€™t have sufficient capacity or supplies to deal with a very high demand.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In that case, you should have a mitigation strategy in place that will allow you to rapidly scale your capacity, or to subcontract some of the work to other parties in order to meet the high demand.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">If you are working with outside partners, one risk that you have to plan for is that the outside parties may not deliver as promised. Your mitigation strategy, in this case, would involve the option of switching to another partner.</span></li>
 	<li>
<h3><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Risk acceptance</strong></span></h3>
<span style="color: #333333;">As the name implies, risk acceptance means you donâ€™t try to avoid or mitigate a risk, but instead choose to live with the consequences.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">This strategy is the best choice if the impact of the risk is small, and avoidance or mitigation would be more expensive than justified by the size of the impact.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">A common example of risk acceptance is planning for potential production delays (within a reasonable time range) since itâ€™s often difficult to predict a precise delivery schedule in advance.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">Active risk acceptance is different from not doing anything, since you are already prepared for the risk occurring, and know that you can live with it because you have calculated the consequences.</span></li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="color: #333333;"><strong>Choosing the best strategy</strong></span></h2>
<span style="color: #333333;">The most important skill in risk management is pairing a precise risk assessment with an appropriate risk management strategy.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In other words, you have to determine which risks you can live with (in which case acceptance is probably a good choice), and which risks will seriously jeopardize your project (in which case you must have an effective plan to deal with the consequences).</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">In the case of the most serious risks, you could actually set up several risk management plans if you want to be on the safe side.</span>

<span style="color: #333333;">A great example of this is the possibility of losing important data due to malware attacks. Every company usually has software in place to protect against these attacks (avoidance), an external backup service (transference), and a strategy to wipe the whole system and restore the data from backup if an attack does succeed (mitigation).</span>";s:10:"post_title";s:63:"The Four Fundamental Strategies of Risk Management for
